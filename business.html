              <p>It’s not hard to see why Bon Apetit magazine once recognized Ithaca as one of the “foodiest” towns in America. With over 50 restaurants in the walkable district serving a variety of cuisine and offering a selection of dining styles from farm-to-table to fine-dining, Downtown Ithaca makes a perfect setting for people to come together to dine deliciously!</p>
              <p>Whether you’re looking for available office or retail space, financial resources, assistance with your business plan; or have questions regarding permits, zoning, or codes – the Downtown Ithaca Alliance will help you get started, and help you grow. The DIA is charged with preserving and developing the central downtown core as the region’s center for specialty shops, restaurants, arts, entertainment, housing, banking and finance, business and professional offices, as well as government and community services. We aim to help those starting a business or bringing a business to this community as well as those looking to expand through years of growth within our Downtown Business Improvement District. The health of your business' entire lifespan is important to us!</p>

We know the needs of small businesses are different than those of large companies and are also very unique to each business. We provide a number of supportive services and funding opportunities to help small businesses, new entrepreneurs, and growing businesses succeed.  Some of these services include grant funding opportunities, marketing technical assistance and promotional support, and networking.</p>
