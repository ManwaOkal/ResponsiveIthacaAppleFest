    <div class="FirstParagraph">
        <p>The apple festival roots go deeper than just the start of Apple Fest. It turns out that the native Iroquois in the Finger Lakes would hold celebrations each season to celebrate their harvest. The festival as we know it today, came into fruition in 1985 when Anna Steinkraus and a few other enthusiastic local farmers wanted there to be a local celebration for their bountiful harvests. From this excited bunch, the annual Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival was created. Anna Steinkraus is the co-owner of Littletree Orchards and was the President of the Ithaca Farmer's Market board of directors at the time.She hasn't missed a single one of the festivals since it started 36 years ago! You can find her and say “Hi” at the Littletree Orchards booth! If you don't know where to find it just look for a long line. Since they will be selling their popular apple cider donuts!</p>
       <p>With heavy involvement from Cornell and a partnership with downtown merchants including David Abdulky and Lyle McCartney, the event was strictly a farmers market. Over time, the addition of food and craft vendors, games, and other activities for children grew the event into what it is today.</p>
       <p>This year, Apple Harvest Festival will host plenty of farmstand fresh apples and produce, delectable apple and seasonal baked goods, a variety of food trucks offering tasty bites, and a craft fair with artisans from around the region. There will also be live music and entertainment, plus a cider trail to enjoy refreshing cider in store and plenty of great apple and apples-inspired products for sale inside shops in and around Downtown.  The event attracts an audience of over 30,000 patrons over the three days</p>
