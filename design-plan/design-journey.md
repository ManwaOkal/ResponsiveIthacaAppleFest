# Project 2: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Understanding Users (Milestone 1)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.


### User Interview Questions (Milestone 1)

### Goals (Milestone 1)
> Analyze your audience's goals from your notes above.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

Goal 1: Get a sense of festivitivity when they visit the apple harvest festival website.
Goal 2: Learn about the festival's past and what it represents to the community.
Goal 3: Understand the cultural heritage of the festival.
Goal 4: Get a list of all the day's planned events.

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - All of the aforementioned objectives are the result of the current apple fest website's inadequate level of information. To make my website more content worthy for my audience, I will have tabs in my design devoted to the objectives they require i.e history, events and business.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - The website for the current apple festival is lacking. We have very few events posted, and the generic content includes things like event time slots. Additionally, we don't know what previous festival goers had to say or why the locals place such a high value on it. Therefore, the website comes out as somewhat generic because it lacks such fundamental information, yet its potential is limitless.

Goal 2: Anyone visiting the website should learn a little about the festival's history.

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - I'll include a section explaining the beginnings of the apple festival and the goals it pursues annually. Additionally, including images of prior apple festivals would help put the current celebration in perspective.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - People like Jeff Kangacha, who are overseas students, should be able to learn more from the apple festival website than just the fact that it is held annually. As research has shown, an event's attendance is boosted when people feel a feeling of patriotic pride for it. It would also be a great chance for the event to market itself as a long-standing tradition.

Goal 3: Visitors to the event should be able to identify the popular events happening at the festival.

- Jennifer needed to be physically present at the festival to find out what main events were happening, which disappointed me. Every culture revolves around heritage, therefore the apple festival website should definitely have a section devoted to it. I'll take a close look at this when re-designing the website.

### Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group with regard to the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival.

- My site's audience will be anyone seeking information about the Ithaca apple festival or  planning on attending the festival. This audience is a cohesive group since they all have one thing in common; They're all seeking information abut the apple festival and that is what I will seek to provide. when re-desining the website.

## Festival/Event Website Design Exploration (Milestone 1)

Identify three festival or event websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web. You will be drawing inspiration from these sites for your own site; please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create.

Include two screenshots of the home page for each site: narrow and wide.

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**

1. <https://onevibeafrica.org/campaign/kisumu-festival/>

### Festival/Event Website 1 Review (Milestone 1)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns in the site.

- The website uses many images, which improves the aesthetic appeal of the site. Additionally, it is simple to navigate, and the image choices portray a lively environment where everyone would adore to be. Additionally, it promotes mainstream musicians, sending the notion that this is a major deal. However, the website's written content, which in this case is more crucial, is obscured by the heavy reliance on graphics. The nav bar being at the top and the logo being on the top left of the navbar are typical design patterns. The navbar also turns into a menu when the view port isÂ small, which is another prevalent design pattern.


### Festival/Event Website 2 Review (Milestone 1)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns in the site.

- The website for the Brazilian event uses a lot of text, which is both a plus and a minus. The website has a lot of information about what actually happens during the event because to its abundance of writing, however this detracts from its appearance. Collapsible navbar menus and responsive images, as opposed to fixed width graphics, are prevalent web design patterns.

### Festival/Event Website 3 Review (Milestone 1)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns in the site.

- The website for the American Dance Festival balances text and visuals. Each falls short of the other. This is a fantastic option because there is harmony between the website's written and visual content. The primary heading often disappears when the material is opened on a narrow screen and reappears on broader screens, with the navigation bar serving as the main exception.


## Content Planning (Milestone 1)

Plan your site's content.

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 1)
> List **all** the content you plan to include your personal website.
> You should list all types of content you planned to include (i.e. text, photos, images, etc.)

- Text - The history of the festival, what is on offer on the website, why the festival is well regarded by the locals, upcoming concerts, etc.
- pictures of the events and the products they sell.
- Links to information about the event, such as sites where it has been featured, etc.

### Content Justification (Milestone 1)
> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how the content addresses their goals.

- In order to save the audience from reading lengthy passages of text that may be summarized in a single image, the images and photos will be for aesthetic and informativeÂ purposes only. The The links will be used to provide additional festival information that is not available on our website The text will serve as a description of the festival's events and its designated time slot.


## Information Architecture (Milestone 1)

### Content Organization (Milestone 1)
> Document your **iterations** of card sorting here. You must have at least 2 iterations of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration.
> Please physically sort cards; please don't try and do this digitally.

![Iteration 1](design-plan/../combine_images.jpg)


- For the iterations above, I grouped contents related to direction together i.e events and social media so that the user can keep track of what is happening in real time. I also grouped the photo gallery, reviews, and food together as they are drectly related. When one wants to order food or try out a new food, it is imperative that they will want to know what others think about it.

![Iteration 2](design-plan/../combine_images2.jpg)

- For the iteration above, I grouped all contents that would need reviews together i.e food and events along with the accompanying social media platforms to keep track of what is happening in real time.

### Final Content Organization (Milestone 1)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

- I will use iteration 1.


> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.

- It was very evident from the interviews I conducted that the website needed to include more information on the history of the festival and what previous attendees had to say about their experiences. In light of this, the site is made to be very user-friendly by grouping the content connected to directions and the content linked to reviews.


### Navigation (Milestone 1)
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- History
- Events
- Business

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience.

- From the interviews I conducted, it was crystal clear that these are the main goals of anyone visiting the site. By having the pages named as what the audience would expect to find, navigating the site becomes easier for even a five year old.


## Visual Theme (Milestone 1)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences. Note the theme you selected for your site and why it's appropriate for the audience and their goals.

- White background and black text. Having this combination of colors creates  rather professional look and the content will be easy to read. This also conveys positive emotions. The contarast between the two colors also makes the content easy to read.

- Yellow text and royal blue background. Due to the happy vibes prevalent in the website, using this combination will help convey a wild spirit. The colors are also calming and kind to the reader's eyes.

- White navigation text with a golden rod background. Dark green makes up the body, with black text set on a white background. The differences in contrast and the color combination  will blend perfectly and will not hurt the  readers' eyes.

## Design (Milestone 1)

Document your site's layout.

### Layout Exploration (Milestone 1)
> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch both the narrow and wide versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

![Wide screen layout sketch](design-plan/../32F93E7B-CF2A-4C36-AB55-80851977D1E4_1_201_a.jpeg)

- For this layout, I sketched the layout of my site had photos of the past events to be the main thing on the front page of the website. Beneath each picture, there are accompanying texts that give content to what is happening on the images. THis layout uses both visual and textual evidences to communicate to the audience thus it is very intuitive.

![Narrow screen layout](../design-plan/BE10691E-FD6B-42A2-8D5F-99F9F1B26E52_1_201_a.jpeg)

- For the narrow screen layout, the content stack up on each other and the images occupy almost 1000vw thus reducing the amount of white space.

### Final Design (Milestone 1)
> Include the final sketches for each of your pages.
> The sketches must include enough detail that another 1300 student could implement them.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch.

**Narrow (Mobile) Design:**

![Narrrow screen layout 1](..design-plan/../IMG_0711.jpeg))

![Narrow screen layout 2](..design-plan/../IMG_0711.jpeg))


![Narrow screen layout 3](..design-plan/../IMG_0711.jpeg))

- I decided to remove the side bar from the small sketches in order to better utilize the space. The site will be simple to use because all the contents will be accessible on desktop and mobile devices thanks to the way the contents are stacked on top of one another.


**Wide (Wide) Design:**

![Wide screen layout 1](..design-plan/../IMG_0710.jpeg)

![wide screen layout 2](..design-plan/../IMG_0712.jpeg)

![Wide screen layout 3](..design-plan/../IMG_0712.jpeg)

- To make the website simple to navigate on large screen displays, I decided to use the same layout for all of the pages. This layout makes it simple to find content and employs text and graphics approximately equally, so no content is obscured.

### Design Rationale (Milestone 1)
> Explain why your design is appropriate for your audience.
> Specially, why does your content organization, navigation, and site design/layout meet the goals of your users?
> How did you employ **design patterns** to improve the familiarity of the site for your audience?

- The layout I choose incorporates both visual and textual elements, making it aesthetically pleasant. The website will undoubtedly be very simple to navigate thanks to the content organization, which took into account what the users requested from the interviews. I also used conventional design strategies, such as placing the navigation bar to the top or side of the page. Additionally, the text is aligned to the left, which is a common design practice.

> Note: You are not required to change your design. Simply tell  us what you would change.

- I would have all my navigation panels at the top of the page since two users seeemed to think that the nsvigstion psnel at the top was the one they should use for navigation.


## Rationale (Final Submission)

**This rationale should be polished writing:** one you might submit as a report to a client or boss to help explain the project and convince them you did a good job. You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.

It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section runs about a paragraph. Sketches can often help tell the story of your design.

Your rationale should be a polished version of the earlier explanations.

### Audience (Final Submission)
> A complete and polished description of the intended audience(s) for your website.

-Anyone looking to learn more about the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival is the website's target audience. Additionally, I'm aiming to draw event organizers who are unsure of when to reserve performance spaces. By listing the events on my website, they can quickly see at what times certain areas are not booked before committing to contacting the space owners to reserve. Finally, the website will be a valuable resource for anyone looking to conduct business at the Ithaca Festival because it has a listing of all the businessÂ opportunities available.

### Audience Goals
> Explain how your site's design addresses the goals of the audience.

- From the interviews I conducted, it was evident that my site's audience needed three things in particular: events, possible business opportunities, and the festival's historical background. My site is strongly focused on these three things thus addresses the goals of my intended audience.


### Visual Design (Final Submission)
> An explanation of how the final design is appropriate for your audience.
> Include design patterns in your rationale.

- From the themes goldenrod theme to the clear contrast between backgrounds and text, my site is kind to the users' eyes. I also named my navigation bar using the same name as the content thus saves the user a lot of time when trying to locate content. Additionally, I used common design principles to make the site easier to navigate, such as placing the navigation bar and page titles at the top of the webpages.


### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments!

- It has been fascinating to learn and apply media querries  which can make a site adapt to the size of the browser. I can't wait to learn more!


## Grading (Final Submission)

### Collaborators
> List any persons you collaborated with on this project.

- None

### Reference Resources
> Please cite any external resources you referenced in the creation of your project.
> (i.e. W3Schools, StackOverflow, Mozilla, etc.)

- I used W3Schools documentation to learn how I can animate my navigation images.
